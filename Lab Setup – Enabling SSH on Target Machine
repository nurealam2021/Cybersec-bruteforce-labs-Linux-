Lab Setup â€“ Enabling SSH on Target Machine.
Before running brute force attack simulations, ensure your lab target machine has SSH enabled. Follow these steps:
1. Install OpenSSH Server
Make sure the SSH server is installed:
$: sudo apt install openssh-server -y

2. Start the SSH Service
$: sudo systemctl start ssh
(Optional) Enable SSH to start on boot:
$: sudo systemctl enable ssh

3. Check SSH Status
Verify that the SSH service is running:
$: sudo systemctl status ssh

You should see a line like:
ssh.service - OpenBSD Secure Shell server
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/ssh.service; enabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: active (running) since Thu 2025-05-22 07:55:33 PDT; 7s ago


4. (Optional) Stop SSH Service
To stop the SSH server:
$: sudo systemctl stop ssh
